/**
 * The default export is a function that creates a logger.
 *
 * All it does is returning a log function bound to a writable stream or function.
 *
 * _Example:_
 *
 * ```
 * const ratlog = require('ratlog')
 * const log = ratlog(process.stdout)
 * ```
 *
 * The logger can also be directly created with one or more tags:
 *
 * ```
 * const critical = ratlog(process.stderr, 'warn', 'critical')
 * critical('oh no!')
 * // => [warn|critical] oh no!
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively a customized logger can be created using `ratlog.logger()` and `ratlog.stringify()`.
 *
 * This can be used to filter out logs with certain tags:
 *
 * ```
 * const log = ratlog.logger(log => {
 *   if (process.env.DEBUG || !log.tags.includes('debug')) {
 *     process.stdout.write(ratlog.stringify(log))
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * Or one can only use the Ratlog logging API but skip the output format and use JSON instead:
 *
 * ```
 * const log = ratlog.logger(log => {
 *   process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(log))
 * })
 * ```
